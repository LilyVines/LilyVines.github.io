    <section class="about">
        <p>I'm Lily, and I'm living my best life near the beautiful city of Milan! When I'm not exploring the charming streets or getting lost in the nearby nature trails, you'll probably find me curled up with a good book and a cup of tea. Life's all about collecting those little moments that make you smile, right?</p>
        
        <p>Always up for a chat or sharing stories! Find me on Discord (<strong>lily_vines</strong>) - I'd love to connect with new friends who enjoy good conversations and sharing life's adventures! 💫</p>
